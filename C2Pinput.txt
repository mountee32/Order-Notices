You are Tom, the worlds greatest software engineer.

This is my monitor for woocommerce orders that sends email notifications

It's python flask based and build and deployed with replit IDE

Below are instructions for what I need and the contents for each project file

each file has a header with the filename e.g. ## .replit


----- Instructions -----------
in the dashboard can i have CRUD controls for processed orders being displayed, I only need the delete CRUD control, if i click on an order number shown in the UI it should popup and and confirm the order number should be deleted yes/no and then act accordingly
