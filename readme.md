**Imports and Setup**
===============

The script imports several Python modules such as `base64`, `html`, `json`, `logging`, among others that assist with web requests, email handling, Excel file manipulation, and environment variable management.

The `dotenv` module is used to load environment variables from a `.env` file, containing sensitive information like usernames, passwords, and API keys.

**Logging Configuration**
=====================

Logging is configured to track the script's operation both in the console and in a rotating log file (`log.txt`). This is crucial for debugging and monitoring the scriptâ€™s performance.

**Email Server and API Credentials**
================================

SMTP server details and authentication credentials are loaded from environment variables, used later for sending emails.

**Fetching Orders**
================

The script uses the `requests` library to fetch orders from an external service (`ORDERS_URL`). Authentication headers are built using Base64-encoded API keys.

It paginates through the results, fetching all orders in "processing" status and storing them in a list.

**Processing Orders**
==================

A list comprehension filters out new orders that haven't been processed before.

For each new order, an Excel workbook is created, and order details such as customer information, payment method, and items ordered are filled in using `openpyxl`. HTML entities in the data are decoded for readability.

**Email Handling**
================

For each order to be processed, the script constructs an email:

* The email contains a multipart message with a text part (packing slip details) and an Excel file attachment (order report).
* The SMTP library (`smtplib`) is used to connect to the SMTP server, authenticate, and send the email.

**Error Handling and Logging**
=============================

The script logs various stages of processing, including successes and failures (e.g., file not found, email send errors).

It tries to robustly handle exceptions, particularly around file operations and email sending.

**Persistence of Processed Orders**
================================

After processing, order IDs are added to a set to mark them as processed.

This set is saved to a JSON file to maintain a record of processed orders, helping to avoid re-processing the same orders on subsequent script runs.
